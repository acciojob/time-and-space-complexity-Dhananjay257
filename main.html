	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity: It is a crucial concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute as a function of the input size. It is denoted using big-O notation, which describes the upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's running time. Efficient algorithms are characterized by low time complexity, indicating that their execution time increases at a reasonable rate even as the input size grows. Developers strive to design algorithms with optimal time complexity to ensure the efficient utilization of computational resources, making it essential for creating high-performance software systems.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>: It is another vital aspect of algorithm analysis, focusing on the amount of memory space an algorithm requires relative to the input size. The notation O(n) is commonly used to express space complexity, where "n" represents the size of the input. Algorithms with O(n) space complexity exhibit linear space usage, meaning that the amount of memory they require scales proportionally with the input size. Managing space efficiently is crucial in developing scalable and resource-friendly software applications, as excessive memory usage can lead to performance bottlenecks and hinder the overall effectiveness of the algorithm. Therefore, evaluating and optimizing space complexity is essential for creating algorithms that strike a balance between memory efficiency and computational speed.</p>
